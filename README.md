# ytl-bounce
A small application that redirects a YouTube link with a channel ID to the popout chat for a live stream on that channel.
This lets you avoid pasting a new YouTube Live link into OBS during each stream.

## Usage
With the program running, set the browser widget URL to `http://localhost:3799/ChannelID`, replacing `ChannelID` with your
own channel's ID.
